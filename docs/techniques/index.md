## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is revolutionizing the way we combine information retrieval with generative AI. This repository showcases a curated collection of advanced techniques designed to supercharge your RAG systems, enabling them to deliver more accurate, contextually relevant, and comprehensive responses.

Our goal is to provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners looking to push the boundaries of what's possible with RAG.


**RAGlib provides a high-level implementation of most common RAG algorithms independently from the database backend.**
